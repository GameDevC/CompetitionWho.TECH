<h2>Project Insomnia is a project based group centered around learning and helping society improve. We work on new projects constantly, and are looking foward to working with not only schools but other groups or people to help expand knowledge on both sides. Our group is still fairly new, but we are working on ways to not only make the team go more public and well known, but also allowing you to be able to contact us easier for help(which includes personal and team contacts). We sincerly hope that we are able to help you with what ever take you are looking foward to.</h2>
