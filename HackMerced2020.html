<h1>Hack Merced</h1>
    <h2>Hack Merced is an event where students have a time limit of 36 hours to make a project in teams of four. We were given three categories to work in. The three categories were health, social good, and sustainability. This was the first time we all worked together and it was the first time most of us met each other. We came into this event not knowing what we were about to do for our project but with time. We spent the first hour thinging up of plans for our project and we came up with the idea of making three projects. We planned to make a two apps and a game. </h2>
      <ul>
        <h1>Project 1: Wake Up</h1>
        <ul>
          <h2>Our goal with this app was to make a social  media app that will promote positivity, while also encouraging fitness and waking up early. This app would be a fitness app where you can connect with your friends and share your goals and acheivments, but you have to wake up early to post your achievements. Upon opening up this app it will great you with a random positive message to improve your mood. You will then be greeted with the daily goals you can achieve and a list of workout options. You can also see what your friends have done so far on the freinds tab.  </h2>
        </ul>
        <h1> Project 2: Founder</h2>
        <ul>
          <h2>Founder was a nonprofit app that make donating to charaties easier. The goal of founder was help you find a charaty to donate to and you can easily donate through the app and you don't need to worry about the app taking any of your money. Base on previous donations and your interest the app will help you find a charity that you might be intrested in.</h2>
         <\ul>
           <h1>Project 3: A Side Scrolling Block Game</h2>
           <ul>
             <h2> This was a simple side scrolling game that was about health. The game followed a block as he neglected his body and his social life to focus on school and it all leads to the blocks demise as he is left alone in an unhealthy body at the end of his unhappy life. </h2>
