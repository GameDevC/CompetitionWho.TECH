<h1>Hack Merced</h1>
    <h2>Hack Merced is an event where students have a time limit of 36 hours to make a project in teams of four. We were given three categories to work in. The three categories were health, social good, and sustainability. This was the first time we all worked together and it was the first time most of us met each other. We came into this event not knowing what we were about to do for our project but with time. We spent the first hour thinging up of plans for our project and we came up with the idea of making three projects. We planned to make a two apps and a game. </h2>
